SEO Performance Analysis & Action Plan for Sunnyside Carpentry
Executive Summary
"What gets measured gets improved." – Peter Drucker

Your carpentry business is receiving search impressions across multiple high-intent local areas, but with a 0.2% CTR and average position 22.1, you're invisible to potential customers. You're on page 3 of Google when customers are making buying decisions on page 1.

Current Situation: The Good and The Bad
✅ What's Working
Geographic spread: You're showing up in 30+ local area searches
Brand awareness: "Sunnyside carpentry" got 1 click from 1 impression (100% CTR!)
Search visibility exists: 200+ impressions across queries
❌ Critical Problems
Zero conversions: 0 clicks from 199 impressions on targeted searches
Page 3 rankings: Position 22.1 means you're essentially invisible
No differentiation: Not ranking for competitive terms in your service areas
Root Cause Analysis
Why You're Missing These Opportunities
Weak local SEO signals – Google doesn't understand where you serve
Poor on-page optimization – Your pages likely lack location-specific content
Insufficient authority – Competitors have stronger backlink profiles and reviews
Generic content – Not targeting specific area + service combinations
Technical gaps – Possible indexing, mobile, or schema markup issues
Action Plan: From Invisible to Inevitable
Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2) - CRITICAL
1. Google Business Profile Optimization
 Claim/verify GBP for primary location
 Add all service areas (Midrand, Randburg, Pretoria, etc.)
 Upload 20+ high-quality project photos with geo-tags
 Post weekly updates about projects in specific areas
 Target: Get first 10 reviews with location mentions
2. Website Technical Audit
 Verify all location pages are indexed (Google Search Console)
 Check mobile responsiveness (critical for local search)
 Implement LocalBusiness schema markup
 Ensure fast page load speeds (<3 seconds)
 Fix any crawl errors or broken links
3. Create Location-Specific Landing Pages
Priority areas based on your data:

Waterkloof Ridge (10 impressions)
Midrand (9 impressions)
Dainfern (9 impressions)
Westonaria (5 impressions)
Alberton (5 impressions)
Each page must include:

Headline: "Expert Carpenter in [Area] | Custom Woodwork & Repairs"
500+ words of unique content about serving that area
Local landmarks, neighborhoods served
5-10 high-quality images of past work
Embedded Google Map
Testimonials from that area (if available)
Clear call-to-action with phone number
Phase 2: Content & Authority Building (Week 3-6)
4. Create High-Value Content
Blog posts to create (one per week):

"10 Custom Carpentry Ideas for [Area] Homes"
"How Much Does a Carpenter Cost in [Area]? 2025 Guide"
"Kitchen Renovation Tips for [Area] Homeowners"
"Built-in Cupboards vs Freestanding: What Works in [Area]?"
5. Build Local Citations & Backlinks
 List on HelloPeter, Snupit, Locanto
 Create profiles on trade directories (Master Builders SA, etc.)
 Get listed on community Facebook groups
 Partner with local hardware stores for referrals
 Join local business chambers
6. Review Generation Strategy
Target: 20 reviews in 90 days

Send review requests immediately after project completion
Offer small discount on next project for honest reviews
Make it easy: Direct link in SMS/WhatsApp
Respond to ALL reviews within 24 hours
Phase 3: Optimization & Scaling (Week 7-12)
7. On-Page SEO Enhancement
For every location page:

 Optimize title tags: "Carpenter [Area] | Custom Woodwork | [Business Name]"
 Meta descriptions with call-to-action (155 characters)
 H1: "Professional Carpenter Services in [Area]"
 H2s: "Custom Kitchens," "Built-in Cupboards," "Decking," etc.
 Alt text on all images: "carpenter-[area]-kitchen-renovation"
 Internal linking between location pages
8. Paid Advertising Bridge (Optional)
While SEO builds, consider:

Google Local Services Ads (pay per lead, not click)
Small Facebook ads budget (R50/day) targeting 5km radius
This generates immediate leads while organic grows
9. Track & Measure
Weekly monitoring in Google Search Console:

CTR improvement (goal: 2%+ by month 3)
Average position (goal: 8-12 by month 3)
Impressions growth
Which areas/queries are improving
Quick Wins (Do This Week)
Update homepage title tag to include primary service area
Add location keywords to existing service pages
Create Google Business Profile if you haven't
Ask your last 5 clients for Google reviews
Fix mobile experience – 80% of local searches are mobile
Add phone number prominently on every page
Expected Timeline
Timeframe	Expected Results
Week 2-4	First page 2 rankings for long-tail terms
Week 6-8	CTR improves to 1-2%
Week 10-12	Page 1 rankings for 3-5 area+service terms
Month 4-6	Average position 8-12, regular lead flow
The Bottom Line
You're 3 months of consistent work away from transforming these impressions into actual customers. The market is searching for you—they just can't see you yet.

Your immediate priority: Location pages + Google Business Profile + reviews. Everything else builds on this foundation.

Budget needed:

Minimal monetary investment (R2,000-5,000 for listings/tools)
Significant time investment (10-15 hours/week) or hire an SEO freelancer (R5,000-10,000/month)
The opportunity is real. The searches are happening. You just need to show up where your customers are looking.

Need help implementing this? Start with the Quick Wins section and tackle one phase at a time. Consistency beats perfection in local SEO.

Understanding Your Search Query Data: A Complete Breakdown
What Is This Data Telling You?
This is Google Search Console data showing how people are finding (or NOT finding) your carpentry business in search results.

Breaking Down Each Column
1. Query (Search Term)
What it means: The exact words people typed into Google

Examples from your data:

"carpenter waterkloof ridge"
"carpenter midrand"
"builder westonaria"
What this tells you: Real people in these specific areas are actively searching for carpenters RIGHT NOW. These aren't random searches—these are potential customers with immediate needs.

2. Clicks
What it means: How many times people clicked on your website link in search results

Your data:

1 click total (from "sunnyside carpentry")
0 clicks from all location-based searches
Why this matters: This is the ultimate failure metric. People are seeing your website in results but NOT clicking. You're losing 199 potential customers.

3. Impressions
What it means: How many times your website appeared in Google search results (even if not clicked)

Your data breakdown:

"carpenter waterkloof ridge" = 10 impressions
"carpenter midrand" = 9 impressions
"carpenter dainfern" = 9 impressions
What this tells you: Your website IS showing up in searches, but it's buried so deep (position 22) that people never scroll down to see it.

The Two Critical Metrics Explained
CTR (Click-Through Rate): 0.2%
Formula: (Clicks ÷ Impressions) × 100

Your calculation: (1 ÷ ~500 total impressions) × 100 = 0.2%

What this means:

Out of every 1,000 times your site appears, only 2 people click
Industry standard for position 20-30: 0.5-1%
Industry standard for position 1-3: 20-35%
Translation: Your listings are so unappealing or buried that 998 out of 1,000 people ignore you.

Average Position: 22.1
What it means: On average, your website appears as the 22nd result in Google

Google results per page: ~10 results

Your position: Bottom of page 3

Reality check:

75% of people never scroll past page 1
90% never go to page 2
99% never reach page 3
Translation: You're essentially invisible. It's like having a shop in a mall's basement parking lot with no signs.

Real-World Translation of Your Data
Let me show you what's actually happening with ONE example:

Example: "carpenter waterkloof ridge"
Impressions: 10
Clicks: 0
Position: ~22
```

**What happened:**
1. 10 different people in Waterkloof Ridge searched for a carpenter
2. Your website showed up in their results (around position 22)
3. They saw the first 10 results (page 1)
4. Maybe looked at page 2
5. **NONE of them even SAW your listing**
6. They hired one of your competitors from page 1

**Lost opportunity:** 10 potential customers who needed exactly what you offer, but you lost them to competitors.

## Geographic Pattern Analysis

### High-Demand Areas (Your Best Opportunities)

| Area | Impressions | What This Means |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Waterkloof Ridge** | 10 | High-value area, active search demand |
| **Midrand** | 9 | Commercial hub, consistent need |
| **Dainfern** | 9 | Affluent estate, quality-focused clients |
| **Vanderbijlpark** | 7 | Growing area, price-conscious market |
| **Pretoria** | 7 | Broad city search, high competition |

### Medium-Demand Areas

| Area | Impressions | Opportunity |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Alberton, Westonaria, Roshnee | 5-8 each | Steady demand, less competition |
| Faerie Glen, Sunward Park | 7-8 each | Suburban family areas |

### Emerging Areas

| Area | Impressions | Strategy |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 20+ locations | 1-6 each | Low competition, easy wins possible |

---

## What Each Query Type Reveals

### 1. **Brand Query: "sunnyside carpentry"**
```
Clicks: 1
Impressions: 1
CTR: 100%
```

**Meaning:** Someone specifically searched for YOUR business name and found you. This is ideal—they already knew about you.

**Problem:** Only 1 person knows your business name. You have zero brand awareness.

---

### 2. **Location + Service: "carpenter [area]"**
```
30+ variations
All with 0 clicks
```

**Meaning:** These are **high-intent** searches. People aren't browsing—they need a carpenter NOW.

**Problem:** You're not showing up where it matters. These customers are hiring your competitors.

---

### 3. **Alternative Searches: "builder westonaria"**
```
Impressions: 5
Clicks: 0
```

**Meaning:** Some people search for "builder" instead of "carpenter." You might be appearing because Google sees them as related.

**Opportunity:** You could also optimize for "builder" terms to capture this audience.

---

## The Brutal Math

Let's calculate your actual losses:

### Conservative Estimate

**Assumptions:**
- Average carpenter job value: R3,500
- Industry average conversion rate (quote to job): 30%
- Your search visibility conversion: 0% (0 clicks)

**Your losses over the data period:**
```
200 impressions (people searching) 
× 20% would click if you were position 1-3 (industry average)
= 40 potential website visitors

40 visitors 
× 30% contact you for quote
= 12 quote requests

12 quotes 
× 30% convert to jobs
= 3-4 jobs

3-4 jobs × R3,500 average
= R10,500 - R14,000 in LOST REVENUE
And this is just from ONE WEEK of data.

Why You're Failing (Technical Breakdown)
Problem 1: Position 22 = Invisible
Google ranks you low because:

Weak website authority (few backlinks)
Poor content relevance (not enough area-specific content)
No local SEO signals (missing Google Business Profile optimization)
Limited reviews/trust signals
Problem 2: 0% CTR Even When Visible
Even when you DO appear, people don't click because:

Your title tag is generic (probably just "Carpentry Services")
Your meta description doesn't compel action
Competitors have star ratings (reviews) showing in results
Your snippet doesn't match search intent
Problem 3: No Geographic Authority
Google doesn't know where you operate:

Website doesn't clearly state service areas
No location-specific pages
No local business schema markup
Inconsistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) across web
Search Intent Translation
Let me decode what each searcher actually wants:

"carpenter waterkloof ridge" =
"I live in Waterkloof Ridge and need a LOCAL carpenter who serves my area, preferably with good reviews and reasonable prices. I want someone who can start soon."

"carpenter midrand" =
"I'm in Midrand, probably need kitchen cabinets or office fit-outs (commercial area). I need someone reliable who shows up."

"builder westonaria" =
"I might need construction work OR carpentry. I'm in a smaller town, so availability matters. Price-sensitive area."

Competitor Advantage (What They Have That You Don't)
Your competitors ranking in positions 1-10 likely have:

✅ Google Business Profile with:

20-100+ reviews (4.5+ star average)
Regular posts and photos
Verified location and service areas
Quick response rate badge
✅ Website optimization:

Dedicated pages for each area they serve
Customer testimonials with photos
Before/after project galleries
Clear pricing guidance
Mobile-friendly design
✅ Trust signals:

"20+ Years Experience"
"500+ Happy Clients"
Industry certifications
Professional photography
✅ Technical SEO:

Fast loading speeds
Schema markup (helps Google understand their business)
Consistent citations across directories
Active social media presence
The Opportunity Cost
What You're Missing RIGHT NOW:
Daily searches in your areas: ~10-15 people

Monthly potential: 300-450 searches

If you were position 1-3:

~60-90 website visits/month
~15-25 quote requests/month
~5-8 new jobs/month
~R17,500-R28,000 additional monthly revenue
Annual opportunity: R210,000-R336,000

What "Average Position 22.1" Actually Looks Like
Imagine you're a customer searching "carpenter midrand":

Page 1 (Positions 1-10):
Top 3 are Google Business Profiles with photos, reviews, star ratings
Positions 4-10 are established carpentry businesses with strong websites
Customer picks from here 90% of the time
Page 2 (Positions 11-20):
Smaller businesses, directory listings
Maybe 5% of customers browse here
Customer might look if not satisfied with page 1
Page 3 (Positions 21-30) - YOU ARE HERE:
Mix of outdated sites, irrelevant results
Virtually no traffic
Customer has already hired someone by now
Summary: What Your Data Means in Plain English
🔴 Critical:

You're getting 200+ chances per week to win customers
You're converting ZERO of them
You're invisible (page 3)
Competitors are eating your lunch
🟡 Opportunity:

Market demand is proven and active
You cover the right geographic areas
Low competition in some areas (1-3 impressions)
Quick wins are possible with basic optimization
🟢 Action Required:

Build location-specific pages
Get Google Business Profile reviews
Improve on-page SEO
Create content that answers local search intent
The Bottom Line
Your search data is screaming: "Customers want you, but they can't find you!"

You're not losing to better carpenters—you're losing to carpenters with better visibility. The work is there. The demand is real. You just need to show up where people are looking.

Next step: Implement the action plan from my previous report, starting with location pages and Google Business Profile.
